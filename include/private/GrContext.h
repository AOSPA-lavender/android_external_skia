    //
    // 1) Create a GrContext as normal, but set fPersistentCache on GrContextOptions to something
    //    that will save the cached shader blobs. Set fShaderCacheStrategy to kSkSL. This will
    //    ensure that the blobs are SkSL, and are suitable for pre-compilation.
    // 2) Run your application, and save all of the key/data pairs that are fed to the cache.
    //
    // 3) Switch over to shipping your application. Include the key/data pairs from above.
    // 4) At startup (or any convenient time), call precompileShader for each key/data pair.
    //    This will compile the SkSL to create a GL program, and populate the runtime cache.
    //
    // This is only guaranteed to work if the context/device used in step #2 are created in the
